## Motivation 
Do you know how to play an instrument? Well, I sure do not. Since I was in middle school, I always wanted to learn how to play an instrument and how to read music. Music theory was something I Unfortunately, I never got the opportunity to do so. As a senior in college, I decided it’s time for that to change. I combined my interest in music and my love for electronics into a Laser Harp Controller that allows one to play a mixture of the notes in an octave by simply waving their hand between the lasers!

## Build Instructions 
The snap-fit build enclosure for the Laser Harp Controller consist of two 7” x 7” x 2” boxes rested on top of each other using a middle thin plank. The back and bottom pieces were left open for ease of access to electrical components. The entire build was cut out of 5.1 mm plywood using and Epilog Fusion Laser Cutter. Tape was used to better secure the snap-fit edges. The Adobe Illustrator files used to cut the necessary pieces are attached below. 

Assemble the two boxes separately, but do not attached the back or bottom pieces. As shown in the figure below. Use the the 1” x 7” piece to connect the boxes together along with as much tape as necessary. Using the holes as guides, place the laser diodes in holes of the top full box and place the photoresistors in the holes of the bottom step box. 

Finally, Place the speaker on top and input breadboards inside build.
